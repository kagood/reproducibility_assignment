#### Target outcomes: 

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in section "Effects of crowding on perception and action" for Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Effects of crowding on perception and action

> Experiment 1 was designed to explore the effects of crowding on perception and action, with a particular focus on whether participants could scale their grip aperture to the size of the target even when they could not consciously identify the size of the target. We carried out a four-way repeated measures ANOVA on the manual estimates and PGAs with task (estimation vs. grasping), crowding condition (uncrowded vs. crowded), viewing condition (closed- vs. open-loop), and target size (3.0 vs. 3.75 cm) as main factors. The significant interaction between task and crowding condition, F(1, 9) = 6.818, p = .028, suggested that crowding had different effects on performance of the grasping and manual estimation tasks. Not surprisingly, when the target was presented in isolation, participants were able to manually estimate the sizes of the two targetsâ€”and this was true for both closed-loop trials, t(9) = 7.23, p < .001, and open-loop trials, t(9) = 9.19, p < .001. Similarly, participants showed excellent grip scaling for targets presented in isolation on both closed-loop trials, t(9) = 4.29, p = .002, and openloop trials, t(9) = 4.79, p = .001 (Fig. 3). Things were quite different, however, when the target disks were surrounded by flankers. In this condition, participants could no longer discriminate between the two disk sizes using a manual estimate closed-loop trials: t(9) = 1.02, p = .334; open-loop trials: t(9) = 1.78, p = .108?presumably because the size of the target was perceptually invisible. (Note that we use the term invisible to refer to the fact that participants could not identify the size of the target, even though they were aware of its presence and position.) In contrast, when participants were asked to grasp the same targets, their PGAs were still scaled to target size?closed-loop trials: t(9) = 4.21, p = .002; open-loop trials: t(9) = 3.392, p = .008 (Fig. 3).

"Un" and "crd" clearly correspond to the "uncrowded" and "crowded" conditions, but it was assumed that "5" and "8" correspond to "3cm" and "3.75cm," respectively.
